# Booksearchengine-22
## Description
```
Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. As the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant. This challenges requests that we refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
